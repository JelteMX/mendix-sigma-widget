# Sigma widget
A Mendix widget to show graphs using [SigmaJS](http://sigmajs.org/)

> This widget is not published yet. Use it for your own projects and come up with use cases. I will publish this widget later on (March 2018) in the AppStore

## Development

This widget is built using [widget-base](https://github.com/JelteMX/widget-base) and [widget-base-helpers](https://github.com/JelteMX/widget-base-helpers). It uses ES6 notation to write clean code and harness the power of `await` and `async`. Webpack will transpile this to clean ES5 code that works in the older browsers as well. (Please note that Mendix 7 will support IE11 and Edge, not the older versions)

## Configuration

> TBD. Should be pretty straight forward
